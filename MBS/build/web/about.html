            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>We believe that commerce belongs to everyone.

From day 1 it's been about much more than transactions; we set out to help entrepreneurs work smarter, make data-driven decisions, and create the best possible experience for their customers. That philosophy still runs through everything that we do.

We are a company infused with culture, just as much as code. Our values are what unite us, but our differences are what inspire us. We get to do the best work of our lives and we celebrate our successes every chance we get.</p>
